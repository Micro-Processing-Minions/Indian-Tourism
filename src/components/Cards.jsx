                        <p>Itâ€™s huge, almost gigantic! That is the first reaction most people have as they speed down the winding road leading to the towering Statue of Unity (SoU). A long bridge connects the mainland to the Sadhu Bet Island, on which the statue stands. Silhouetted against the surrounding Vindhya and Satpura mountain ranges, the colossal statue almost seems to pierce the skyline.</p>

                        <p>India's shorelines are endowed with a glorious beauty that is reflected in its undulating golden beaches that make for an ideal vantage point to watch the sun dipping into the sea. Beaches stroke both the eastern and western coasts of the Indian peninsula. They also act as sentinels of the rich cultural heritage of India and host many temples, memorials and monuments. Several beaches in the country are sites of adventure sports like skiing, scuba diving, parasailing and windsurfing. India's coastal line lures many migratory birds and aquatic life to come and nestle on the sun-kissed shores.</p>
